    "## 1. Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    " - **Purpose:** To investigate a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using pythong fundamentals only. This is part of my Machine Learning journey and serves as an opportunity to put my python knowledge to the test. While I will perform basic statistical analysis on the dataset to gain more insight, the core of the project is based on my question below:\n",
    " - **Question:** Do smokers from this dataset have higher average medical insurance cost than non-smokers?\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Dataset Description:** Data originally  from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance), but has been prepared by Codecademy in a .csv file. variables include age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking, and charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Note: One of the columns contains BMI data. While insurance companies do use BMI in their calculations, and that is reflected in this project, BMI is not necessarily an accurate predictor of health. As data scientists, we should always be skeptical of quantitative measures like BMI that reduce complex phenomena to a single number.\"\n"
